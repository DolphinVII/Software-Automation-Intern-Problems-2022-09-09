Here are my solutions to the given problems (see attached or download them from my GitHub page). 
Factorial is a standalone file for the first question, including a main function and the factorial(n) function. 
SynopsysOO is the main file for the second question, featuring a unit test for every class, variable, and method. It requires access to the University class file (which includes all other classes and methods required for the solution). The University OO Diagram file has the OO Class Diagram.
